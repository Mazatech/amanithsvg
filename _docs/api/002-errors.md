# Errors

## Errors

Some AmanithSVG functions may encounter errors. Unless otherwise specified, any value returned from a
function following an error is undefined. An error condition within an AmanithSVG function must never result
in process termination, with the exception of illegal memory accesses taking place within functions that
accept an application provided pointer.

All AmanithSVG functions may signal `SVGT_OUT_OF_MEMORY_ERROR`. Such an error may occur midway
through the execution of an AmanithSVG function, in which case the function may have caused changes to
the state of AmanithSVG (or to drawing structures) prior to failure. When an AmanithSVG function encounters an error other than a `SVGT_OUT_OF_MEMORY_ERROR`, the context state is not modified and no
drawing takes place.

All possible error codes are defined by the enumeration type `SVGTErrorCode`.

| Error code | Notes |
| ---------- | ----- |
| `SVGT_NO_ERROR` | Defined as 0 |
| `SVGT_NOT_INITIALIZED_ERROR` | It indicates that the library has not previously been initialized through the `svgtInit` function |
| `SVGT_BAD_HANDLE_ERROR` | |
| `SVGT_ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT_ERROR` | |
| `SVGT_OUT_OF_MEMORY_ERROR` | |
| `SVGT_PARSER_ERROR` | |
| `SVGT_INVALID_SVG_ERROR` | Returned when the library detects that outermost element is not an `<svg>` element or there is a circular dependency (usually generated by `<use>` elements) |
| `SVGT_STILL_PACKING_ERROR` | |
| `SVGT_NOT_PACKING_ERROR` | |
